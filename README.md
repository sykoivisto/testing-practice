# Testing Practice

## Description

This project was a quick excercise for me to start using tests in my future projects. I practiced TDD here, writing the tests first, and creating the functions to satisfy the tests.

I used jest to test, and babel to make imports work with jest. Everything worked out good! Writing the tests firsts provides a bit of guidance to creating functions; having a clear goal when writing functions can make things more simple.
